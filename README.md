# FintCar_Catalog
This is my first project, using Django-Rest-Framework. The project is about a catalog of a car shop. Inittialy, I'm trying just API configuration, for my learning. Soon i will create the FrontEnd, using React.js.

## How to use
- First, install Python version 3.9
- Do the install 'requirements.txt' with 'pip install -r requirements.txt'.
- Use 'manage.py migrate' to do the migrations, and use 'manage.py runserver' para iniciar o servidor localmente.
